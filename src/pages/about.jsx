          Hi! I’m Kaanisha, a passionate developer with interest in React, 
          Web Design, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy building interactive 
          web applications and constantly learning new technologies.
        </p>

        <p className="about-description">
          I love turning ideas into real-world solutions. When I’m not coding, 
          you can find me sketching, exploring design trends, or experimenting 
          with new creative projects.
        </p>
